Spritesheet generator for Adobe Illustrator

Installation
======================

To include a script in the Scripts menu (File > Scripts), save the script in the Scripts folder, located in the 
/Illustrator CS6/Presets folder in your Illustrator CS6 installation directory. The scriptâ€™s filename, 
minus the file extension, appears in the Scripts menu.

Scripts that you add to the Scripts folder while Illustrator is running do not appear in the Scripts menu until 
the next time you launch Illustrator
